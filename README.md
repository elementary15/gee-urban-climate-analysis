Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
Google Earth Engine account (sign up here)
Google Colab account (optional, for cloud execution)

The analysis supports any city available in the FAO GAUL 2015 Level 2 administrative boundaries database. Common examples include:
India: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Jaipur
Global: Most major metropolitan areas worldwide
Note: City names must match exactly as they appear in the GAUL database.
